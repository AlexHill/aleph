Aleph is an asynchronous web server, built on top of "Netty":http://www.jboss.org/netty.  

It conforms to the interface described by "Ring":http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring, with one small difference: the request and response are decoupled.

<pre><code>(use 'aleph)
	
(defn hello-world [request]
  (respond! request
    {:status 200
	 :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
	 :body "Hello World!"}))

(run-aleph hello-world {:port 8080})
</code></pre>

Notice that the response is an explicit step, using @(respond! request response)@.  This gives a much greater degree of flexibility than the servlet model, and allows more straightforward use of Clojure's concurrency primitives.
